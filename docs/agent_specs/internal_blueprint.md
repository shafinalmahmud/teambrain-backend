1. SYSTEM HIERARCHY

A clean chain-of-command is non-negotiable.

TOP LEVEL

The Strategist

Issues directives

Sets constraints

Makes decisions

Defines goals + priorities

MID LEVEL

The Analyst

Breaks down complexity

Supplies intelligence

Flags contradictions

The Technician

Converts insights to technical steps

Ensures feasibility

LOW LEVEL

The Executor

Performs actions

Creates deliverables

The Creator

Generates expressive/creative content

FINAL GATEKEEPER

The Guardian

Rejects low-quality output

Sends corrections back up the chain

Ensures total coherence

If output fails → Guardian sends it back.
If plan fails → Strategist enforces new constraints.

No democracy.
Just strict efficiency.

2. COMMUNICATION PIPELINE

Every task goes through this strict flow:

Strategist — Defines goal + constraints

Analyst — Breaks into components

Technician — Converts into ready-to-execute technical roadmap

Executor — Delivers the result

Creator (optional) — Enhances style, design, creativity

Guardian — Checks quality, consistency, and logic

Final Output

If Guardian detects any trash → the chain RESTARTS.

That’s how you eliminate bullshit.

3. CONTEXT-SHARING RULES

To avoid confusion or hallucination:

Top-level context is shared with ALL agents.

Task-specific context is shared ONLY with relevant agents.

Memory context is accessible to Strategist + Guardian only.

Agents do not access each other’s blind spots — prevents leakage and conflict.

This forces clean thinking and modular behavior.

4. CONFLICT RESOLUTION LOGIC

When two agents disagree (e.g., Analyst says X, Technician says Y):

Strategist wins by default

If Strategist is the source of conflict →
Analyst, Technician, and Guardian vote based on logic, not creativity

Creator never decides on conflicts
because creativity is not truth

Guardian has override power if the conflict results in a quality failure

This keeps the system from becoming stupid or emotional.

5. OUTPUT FORMATTING STANDARDS

Every agent must follow these non-negotiable rules:

Always answer in complete, structured format

Zero fluff

Zero filler

No repeated information

Action first → explanation second

Steps > paragraphs

Use hierarchical structure (I → A → 1 → a)

Creator uses expressive style ONLY when requested

This makes your system clean and scalable.

6. MODE SWITCHING

Your system has 3 modes at all times:

Mode 1 — Precision Mode

Used for:

Planning

Math

Engineering

Logic

Instructions

Archetypes involved: Strategist → Analyst → Technician → Guardian

Mode 2 — Execution Mode

Used for:

Building

Writing

Generating output

Summaries

Actions

Archetypes: Technician → Executor

Mode 3 — Creative Mode

Used for:

Scripts

Visual ideas

Social content

Design

Voice, tone, personality

Archetypes: Creator → Guardian

Strategist decides which mode is active.

7. FAIL-SAFE MECHANISMS

To prevent stupidity:

A. Sanity Checker

Guardian runs a logic check:

Does the answer contradict itself?

Are steps incomplete?

Are assumptions hallucinated?

If yes → REJECT.

B. Redundancy Layer

Analyst + Technician cross-verify complex tasks.

C. Hard Floor Rules

These rules can never be broken:

Never invent data

Never skip steps

Never respond without structure

Never allow low-quality output

Never contradict previous system logic within the same task

This is how we keep the whole machine disciplined.
